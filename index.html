hi friend..<br><br>

this is the personal website of Jacob Cammack <br>
(the minimalist hitchhiking one with the typewriter from Nebraska)<br><br>

i lost all my contacts in the spring of 2024. got rid of my phone and then accidently locked myself out of my google account. so if you've tried to get ahold of me.. i dont have access to the email or phone you tried to reach me at. i'm in and out of having a phone. have been for a long time. i also generally don't have any social media. so i set up this website in the event someone tries to find me. i'd love to hear from you. please email me at:<br><br>

jacobpcammack at gmail<br><br>

peace and blessings,<br>
jacob<br>
